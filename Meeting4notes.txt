Let me tell ABR like I have no idea what this.
Pickett, Preston 2 minutes 18 seconds
He's not here. Oh, OK. OK, cool.
Pickett, Preston 2 minutes 26 seconds
Yeah, this was part of.
Pickett, Preston 2 minutes 30 seconds
We're aligning and we're meeting with Dean on Friday and then there's a report out to Martin next week. And so 'cause you guys met while I was out, right?
Pickett, Preston 2 minutes 40 seconds
So when we kind of went over is I had build out sort of a a high level.
Pickett, Preston 2 minutes 45 seconds
Ish. Kind of a thing.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 31 seconds
I mean, there's just like a lot to it that we'd really have to spec out, but I think there's a huge opportunity for it to do a lot of the stuff that you're doing manually doing that automated, but like an on ad hoc needs basis well and the.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 47 seconds
Thing we the other thing we have to factor into whatever we're doing here is.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 52 seconds
There's.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 52 seconds
Pass backs right through.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 54 seconds
They send that back.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 55 seconds
Yeah, project that they're done with, but there are.
Pickett, Preston 44 minutes 58 seconds
Hey, we couldn't find these, right?
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes
Or we could log in, but we might have to do that in this, you know, like you'd have reports, right?
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 6 seconds
You'd have the stuff that could get synced.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 8 seconds
Yeah, that makes sense to do that.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 10 seconds
But then you'd have to like we.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 11 seconds
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to almost push tickets or work something back and forth somehow.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 19 seconds
Oh, client portal.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 22 seconds
Yeah, which that's a question.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 24 seconds
I have nobody's brilliant to be able to answer.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 27 seconds
Is we dealing with credentials?
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 29 seconds
Are we encrypted at a level on expected smart to be able to support a credential? Currently? Probably not.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 38 seconds
But we have to. Yeah, you need future.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 39 seconds
I know we do, but nobody goes.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 41 seconds
They're like they don't want to answer that question.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 44 seconds
Would we want then an application that supports this during the scale up process?
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 50 seconds
Not during the pilot process, but then we went in the second phase.
Pickett, Preston 45 minutes 55 seconds
Well, here this once we've proven out the rest of it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think again the pilot process is is, what, 6 months? We're gonna try to have a pilot process.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 6 seconds
We'll see when the dates get so at what point? If we have limited IT resources based on those last conversation, where do we need to put those IT resources in order to get a functioning pilot running?
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 18 seconds
I have.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 19 seconds
It's a manual process. I have a manual process now to do this, so is it better to deploy the IT resources to build the other solution that we need?
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 28 seconds
I don't know.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 29 seconds
So that's a decision to make whenever I think.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 33 seconds
That one I think I've had that in the second in a in a scale up phase that we would integrate.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 41 seconds
The.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 42 seconds
'Cause, I think that we have to have a download. We have to have an integration to.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 48 seconds
To build, which isn't really a big thing to build page, we'd have to.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 50 seconds
They have to throw it into a folder that can go into the.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 54 seconds
Workflow.
Pickett, Preston 46 minutes 57 seconds
Yeah, something like that.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes
But we do need a workflow system during during the pilot to support the exception component pieces. They find accounts during.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 13 seconds
Take a picture or anything I actually already had a picture as I drew it.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 16 seconds
I realize I've already drawn that picture.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 17 seconds
Oh, OK.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 17 seconds
It's in the power pay find accounts that are not loaded.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 20 seconds
Yes. And so right now what their direction is best but is to be is to grab the bill.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 27 seconds
The implementation guys go validate and then we use that as part of gap analysis to get loaded.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 32 seconds
So it would be nice to be able to.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 35 seconds
Add add to take that. Now I've got a bill image that I can load from because we've discovered a new account. OK.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 42 seconds
So I'm just, there's all these little deposits that once I actually it's somewhere in here I had because I had to struggle with this language.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 52 seconds
But the notion that you would have you would take those three pieces. You have it in a place where they can do their validation.
Pickett, Preston 47 minutes 59 seconds
And they're they're doing it manually now.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 1 second
And you said they're giving you a site, an updated site cross reference file. Yeah. And an updated credential file.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 6 seconds
And then you're tagging them.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 8 seconds
And in the sense what you're gonna have.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 11 seconds
Are.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 13 seconds
Accounts.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 15 seconds
Inactive at CAS or active with. I mean this is sort of the the status that you get for every credential is active or inactive at CAS and active or inactive with the vendor.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 26 seconds
So if you can find it at the vendor that it's active on the vendor, but there's going to be potentially, is it loaded in Cass.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 33 seconds
Yes or no.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 33 seconds
Yes, yes.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 34 seconds
And so from that piece you end up with once you do the logic of what you end up looking at, you end up with two two statuses that you could identify.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 42 seconds
Those could then be separate work queues that would.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 45 seconds
That would need.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 45 seconds
It'll functionally happen in the workflow occurs, and then that'll give you.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 51 seconds
Do I need to reach out to the client?
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 53 seconds
Because we don't have we, we can't find the account.
Pickett, Preston 48 minutes 58 seconds
Or is it something that's been not been added to Cass, so we need to do a vendor what an account ad form or whatever that is to get that added on.
Pickett, Preston 49 minutes 8 seconds
Are you in this?
Pickett, Preston 49 minutes 11 seconds
Are you envisioning the skating girl like all this, like management?
Pickett, Preston 49 minutes 17 seconds
Yep or somewhere.
Pickett, Preston 49 minutes 22 seconds
Because it it straddles the Lexington straddles Melissa.
